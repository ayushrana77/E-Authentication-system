# E-Authentication-system

It is the login and register page. For the front-end, I
used to react to create a web application. the user
enters the details it will send OTP to the user via email
if the user enters the correct OTP. If they enter the
incorrect OTP, it will not authenticate the user. it will
show the profile when the user register. Data will be
stored in the NoSQL database MongoDB.for backend I
used a python flask to create API.
